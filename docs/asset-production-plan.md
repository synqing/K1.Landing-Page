# K1-Lightwave Asset Production Plan

Complete workflow for producing all visual assets using A7S III camera, 3D rendering (STL/STEP files), and AI generation (Gemini Ultra).

---

## Asset Strategy Hierarchy

### Priority Order

**70% Real Photography/Video (A7S III)** → Authenticity, conversions
**20% 3D Renders (STL/STEP files)** → Impossible angles, diagrams
**10% AI Generation (Gemini)** → Backgrounds, UI mockups only

**Why this order:**
- A7S III low-light performance = perfect for LED photography
- Real hardware = instant credibility (no "is this vaporware?" doubt)
- 3D renders = fill gaps where physical shots impractical
- AI = supplementary only (backgrounds, contexts)

---

## PRIORITY 1: Real Photography/Video (A7S III)

### Camera Settings for LED Photography

**Base Configuration:**
- Format: 4K 24fps (cinematic) or 4K 60fps (smooth motion)
- Picture Profile: S-Log3 (maximum color grading flexibility)
- ISO: 3200-6400 (A7S III's sweet spot in low light)
- Shutter: 180° rule (1/50s @ 24fps, 1/120s @ 60fps)
- Aperture: f/2.8-f/4 (balance DOF with sharpness)
- White Balance: 5600K (daylight, adjust in post)
- Focus: Manual (LEDs will confuse autofocus)

**Lens Recommendations:**
- Hero shots: 35mm or 50mm (natural perspective)
- Detail shots: 90mm macro (show LED detail, dual-edge)
- Context shots: 24mm (show K1 in full desk setup)

---

### Complete Shot List

#### **CRITICAL PATH (Shoot First - 2 Hours)**

**Shot 1: Hero Angle - The Money Shot**
```
Setup:
- K1 on desk, slight 3/4 angle (not dead-on)
- Single light source top-left (matches PRISM.node aesthetic)
- Dark background (black seamless paper or dark wall)
- K1 running "Fire" palette (warm, inviting)
- Monitor glow in background (subtle, out of focus)

Camera:
- 35mm or 50mm lens

- Shoot RAW (Sony ARW format)

Deliverable: 1 RAW photo
Landing Page Use: Hero section background
```

**Shot 2: Hero Video Loop**
```
Same setup as Shot 1, but:

### Lighting Setup (Matches PRISM Aesthetic)

```
         [KEY LIGHT]
              ↓
         (top-left, 45°)
              |
              |
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │                 │ ← Desk
    │      [K1]       │
    │                 │
    └─────────────────┘
         ↑
    (Camera, eye level)

[BOUNCE CARD] →  (optional fill, right side, subtle)
```

**Key Light Specs:**
- LED panel (Aputure MC, Nanlite PavoTube, or similar)
- Daylight balanced (5600K)
- Diffused (softbox or bounce off ceiling)
- Power: 10-30W (K1 LEDs should be brightest in frame)

---

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| LEDs too bright | Lower ISO to 1600-3200, use S-Log3 |
| LEDs pixelated | Shoot from further away, use longer focal length (90mm) |
| Color shift during palette change | Lock white balance, grade in post |
| Motion blur on fast patterns | Increase shutter (1/100s+), sacrifice motion blur |
| Flicker on video | Ensure LED refresh rate >200Hz, use 180° shutter |
| Background too dark | Add subtle fill light (white bounce, 10% power) |

---

### Post-Production Workflow

**Color Grading (DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere):**
1. Import S-Log3 footage
2. Apply Sony S-Log3 → Rec.709 conversion LUT
3. Match PRISM.node aesthetic:
   - Crush shadows slightly (dark background)
   - Boost LED colors (saturation +10-15%)
   - Add subtle vignette (focus on K1)
   - Color temp: Cool (5500-6000K)
4. Export: H.264, 1080p or 4K, <5MB for hero video

**Export Specs:**
- Hero video: 1080p, H.264, <5MB
- Bento videos: 720p, H.264, <2MB each
- Photos: JPEG (web), 1920px wide, sRGB color space

---

## PRIORITY 2: 3D Rendering (Blender/KeyShot)

### When to Use 3D Instead of Photos

| Use Case | Why 3D? |
|----------|---------|
| Exploded view | Show internals, impossible with photo |
| Perfect symmetry | No parallax, perfectly centered |
| Impossible angles | Floating in space, no desk needed |
| Technical diagrams | Clean, labeled, educational |
| Customization preview | Show colors not yet built |
| 360° turntable | Product exploration |

### Gemini Best Practices

**Prompt Engineering:**
1. **Be style-specific:**
   - "photorealistic, shot on Sony A7IV" (contexts)
   - "clean technical illustration" (diagrams)
   - "modern UI mockup, high fidelity" (software)

2. **Reference brand colors:**
   - Always include: "dark background #1C2130, cyan #6EE7F3, gold #FFB84D"
   - "glassmorphism effects with blur"

3. **Aspect ratios:**
   - Hero: 16:9 (landscape)
   - Mobile mockups: 9:16 (portrait)
   - Icons: 1:1 (square)

4. **Iteration:**
   - Generate 4 variations per prompt
   - Pick best 1-2
   - Refine: "Same as previous, but [adjustment]"

5. **Avoid:**
   - Text (AI struggles with readable text)
   - Specific dimensions (it'll hallucinate)
   - Multiple distinct objects (inconsistency)

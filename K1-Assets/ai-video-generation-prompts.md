# K1-Lightwave Video Generation Prompts

## Hero Video Assets (Music-Reactive / Light Show)

### Prompt 1: Epic LED Reveal
**Duration:** 5-8 seconds  
**Style:** Cinematic hardware reveal  
**Scene:** Start with K1 in darkness. Dramatic music builds. LEDs gradually illuminate from left to right edge in synchronized waves. Lights pulse with bass drops. Camera slowly pans around device revealing the dual edge-lit design.

**Key Details:**
- Dark background (black or deep charcoal)
- RGB LED lights: blues, purples, magentas dominating
- Rhythmic pulses synced to upbeat techno/electronic music
- Shallow depth of field keeping K1 in focus
- Subtle camera dolly/pan movements

### Prompt 2: Ambient Loop - Cool Tech
**Duration:** 10-15 seconds (repeating loop)  
**Style:** Lofi, chill, ambient  
**Scene:** K1 resting on desk with soft blue-cyan LED pulse breathing pattern. Gentle waves of light move across edges. Minimalist, zen aesthetic. No music required - focus on visual rhythm.

**Key Details:**
- Cool blue/cyan/teal color palette
- Slow breathing light pattern (3-4 sec cycle)
- Static camera angle (3/4 view from earlier renders)
- Warm desk lighting + K1 glow creates atmosphere
- No fast movements - purely meditative

### Prompt 3: Gaming/Performance Demo
**Duration:** 6-10 seconds  
**Style:** High-energy, fast-paced  
**Scene:** K1 displaying rapid fire LED sequences. Neon RGB colors (hot pink, lime green, cyan). Geometric patterns chase along edges. Synced to energetic electronic/synthwave music with strong beat.

**Key Details:**
- Bright neon colors: hot pink, lime green, cyan, orange
- Fast LED sequences (checkerboard, chase, strobe patterns)
- Synced to ~120+ BPM electronic music
- More aggressive camera moves allowed
- Slight lens flare/bloom effects from bright LEDs

### Prompt 4: Developer Flex
**Duration:** 8-12 seconds  
**Style:** Technical, precise, "hacker aesthetic"  
**Scene:** K1 displaying custom code patterns. Binary rain effect over device. Precise geometric patterns (grids, hexagons, waves) rendered in single color (monochrome green on black, or white on black).

**Key Details:**
- Monochrome tech look (single color on black background)
- Mathematical/geometric LED patterns
- Code or circuit patterns visible
- Minimal music or synthetic beeps/glitches
- Clean, precise camera framing

---

### Prompt 5: Social Media Loop (Instagram/TikTok)
**Duration:** 3-5 seconds  
**Style:** Quick, punchy, attention-grabbing  
**Scene:** Fast cuts between different LED patterns and angles. Each 0.5-1 second cut shows different color scheme. Music has hooks/drops every cut. Designed to make viewers stop scrolling.

**Key Details:**
- Multiple color schemes: cool blues → warm oranges → RGB rainbow
- Very fast cuts (0.5-1.5 sec per scene)
- Synced to music with clear beat hits
- Different camera angles showcasing device
- Vertical format (9:16) for mobile

### Prompt 6: Use Case - Home Theater Setup
**Duration:** 8-10 seconds  
**Style:** Warm, premium, lifestyle  
**Scene:** K1 positioned in home theater context. Soft warm LEDs (amber, warm white) creating ambient lighting. Subtle, sophisticated light patterns. Minimal movement.

**Key Details:**
- Warm color palette: amber, warm white, soft gold
- Sophisticated, subtle animations
- Positioned in realistic home theater/desk setup
- Professional ambient lighting vibe
- Movie/premium product feel

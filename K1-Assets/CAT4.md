# Category 4: Full Light Show Video Generation Prompt (HERO VIDEO)

## Seed Image Required
`k1-dark-three-quarter.png` from `/01-keyshot-seeds/cat4-light-ready-dark/`

## Primary Prompt - THIS IS YOUR MONEY SHOT

"Dual edge-lit light guide plate activating with synchronized addressable RGB LED visualization pattern, one hundred sixty individually controlled LEDs per edge creating precise color addressability, light pattern starts from center and radiates outward in symmetrical wave motion toward both ends of device, color spectrum transitions smoothly from deep electric blue to vibrant cyan to warm amber to soft magenta creating flowing gradient wash across transparent acrylic light guide panel, light diffusing evenly through engineered acrylic creating volumetric glow effect where colors blend at boundaries, subtle intensity variation synchronized to implied musical beat pattern with peaks at 0.5 second intervals suggesting audio-reactive behavior, camera executes slow controlled dolly movement from right to left over 12 seconds maintaining perfect side profile view of device, pure black void background providing maximum contrast for LED glow, subtle halo effect around device edges where brightest LED zones create soft bloom in camera, light bleeding naturally beyond physical device boundaries, maintain exact device geometry with no shape morphing, preserve aluminum housing as dark silhouette while acrylic plate glows internally, add subtle lens flare when brightest cyan LEDs hit peak intensity around 4 second mark, cinematic color grading emphasizing saturated LED colors while keeping black levels crushed for drama"

## Technical Parameters
- Duration: 12 seconds
- Frame rate: 24fps or 30fps (test both)
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Output format: MP4 (H.264)

## Color Scheme Variations To Try

### Variation A (Cool Spectrum):
"LED pattern uses only cool colors: deep blue → cyan → white → light blue, creating ice-like clinical precision feel, slower color transitions emphasizing technical sophistication over entertainment"

### Variation B (Warm Sunset):
"LED pattern transitions warm amber → orange → red → magenta, creating cozy studio atmosphere, faster pulsing pattern suggesting energetic music rather than ambient soundscape"

### Variation C (Rainbow Spectrum):
"Full spectrum color wheel transition hitting all hues: red → orange → yellow → green → cyan → blue → magenta → back to red, suggesting maximum creative flexibility and customization possibilities"

## CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

This video MUST accomplish these specific goals:
1. Make viewer think "I've never seen light behave like that before"
2. Clearly show the dual-edge lighting architecture (light coming from both top and bottom edges)
3. Demonstrate that colors can change and flow (not static)
4. Suggest synchronization/timing without showing actual audio (the rhythm of color changes implies beat sync)
5. Make the device feel premium and technically sophisticated, not like a toy

## What To Watch For
- Device geometry staying exact (AI might try to change the shape)
- Light actually appearing to emit FROM the edges, not randomly from center of panel
- Colors blending naturally where they meet, not hard boundaries
- Black background staying truly black (RGB 0,0,0) not turning gray
- Camera movement being smooth without acceleration/deceleration artifacts
- Halo/bloom effects looking natural not overdone
- No hallucinated UI elements, buttons, or features that don't exist

## If Output Doesn't Hit The Mark

### Problem: Colors look muddy or blend poorly
Solution: Specify "maintain high color saturation throughout, colors should remain distinct even when adjacent, use gradient blending but preserve color intensity"

### Problem: Light doesn't appear to come from edges
Solution: Add to prompt "light emission originates specifically from top edge PCB strip and bottom edge PCB strip, 160 LED point sources per edge clearly visible as origin of light diffusion into acrylic"

### Problem: Too static, not enough motion
Solution: Add "increase animation speed to 2x, color transitions complete in 2-3 seconds instead of 4-5, add secondary pulse pattern overlaid on primary gradient creating layered visual complexity"

### Problem: Too busy, feels chaotic  
Solution: Simplify to "single slow gradient sweep from left to right, blue to amber only, one complete cycle over 12 seconds, minimal intensity variation, emphasize smooth elegance over excitement"

## Landing Page Integration Strategy

**This video should be THE FIRST THING users see when they land on the page.**

Place it in the right side of your hero section where we previously had the HUD cards and fake graph. The split-screen layout puts copy/CTA on the left, and this mesmerizing light animation on the right.

The psychological sequence you're creating is:
1. User lands on page
2. Video immediately catches attention with unusual light behavior
3. Brain thinks "what is this?" (curiosity engaged)
4. Eyes flick left to headline which answers: "320 LEDs. Dual Edge-Lit. Audio-Reactive."  
5. Brain connects visual (the light show) with explanation (the specs)
6. Instant understanding: "Oh, this device creates those light patterns I'm watching"
7. Desire triggers: "I want to control those patterns myself"

If this video doesn't create that sequence, nothing else on the page matters. This is the asset that justifies the $249 price point and the March 2026 wait.

## Absolute Worst Case Backup Plan

If AI video generation completely fails to produce satisfactory results after 5+ attempts, you have two options:

**Option A:** Use your KeyShot or Blender to render an actual animated sequence where you manually keyframe the LED colors changing. More time intensive but gives you perfect control. Export as video.

**Option B:** Create a series of 6-8 still images showing the device with different LED color states, then use simple cross-fade transitions between them. Less impressive than fluid animation but still demonstrates the color-changing capability.

Do not launch without some form of light animation video. The entire value proposition depends on showing the visual magic.
